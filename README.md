# Thermography_Condition_Monitoring
Automatic Thermography for Condition Monitoring of Electrical Systems

You need to install `pylepton`, a quick and dirty pure python library for capturing images from the Lepton over SPI. It requires `cv2` and `numpy` modules.

My application needs `pygame` library for GUI.

You could run **prerequisite.sh** to install all pre-requisites.

Then you can enjoy by using **python** to run `Thermal_Imaging.py`.

The FLIR Lepton in all its glory.
